# Aww2

Cutie (project name: Aww) was built as an iOS app that pulls the cutest animal gifs, images and video from the web into a single feed. The primary source of content was Reddit, and specifically the r/Aww subreddit. 

Users were then able to build a collection of their favorite posts, as well as share them out with friends on social media, email or SMS.

The app was submitted and approved on the iOS app store in 2015.
